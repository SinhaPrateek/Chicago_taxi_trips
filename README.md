# Chicago Taxi Trips Problem

## Objective

Develop a model to predict transit time between two different locations in the Chicago Taxi Trips data. Evaluation metric to be used is Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Data from 2013 to 2016 has to be used for training and 2017 for
testing.

## Problem Statement
Predicting time taken to go from one place to another is one of the crucial planning input to decide and optimize the operations. In
this challenge, you will develop a solution to predict the transit time for going from a Pickup area to a Dropoff Area in the data.
## Dataset
This dataset includes taxi trips from 2013 to 2017 (till July), reported to the City of Chicago in its role as a regulatory agency. To
protect privacy but allow for aggregate analyses, the Taxi ID is consistent for any given taxi medallion number but does not show the
number, Census Tracts are suppressed in some cases, and times are rounded to the nearest 15 minutes. Due to the data reporting
process, not all trips are reported but the City believes that most are. See http://digital.cityofchicago.org/index.php/chicago-taxi-
data-released for more information about this dataset and how it was created.
Use data from 2013 to 2016 for learning and 2017 for testing. Your results will be based on MAPE on 2017 data.
